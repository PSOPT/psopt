Introduction
------------

This is the PSOPT library, a software tool for computational [optimal control](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Optimal_control)

PSOPT is an open source optimal control package written in C++ that uses [direct collocation methods](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/16M1062569). These methods solve optimal control problems by approximating the time-dependent variables using global or local polynomials. This allows to discretize the differential equations and continuous constraints over a grid of nodes, and to compute any integrals associated with the problem using well known quadrature formulas. [Nonlinear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_programming) then is used to find local optimal solutions. PSOPT is able to deal with problems with the following characteristics:

-  Single or multiphase problems
-  Continuous time nonlinear dynamics
-  General endpoint constraints
-  Nonlinear path constraints (equalities or inequalities) on states and/or control variables
- Integral constraints
-  Interior point constraints
-  Bounds on controls and state variables
-  General cost function with Lagrange and Mayer terms.
-  Free or fixed initial and final conditions
- Linear or nonlinear linkages between phases
-  Fixed or free initial time
-  Fixed or free final time
- Optimisation of static parameters
- Parameter estimation problems with sampled measurements â€¢ Differential equations with delayed variables.

The implementation has the following features:

- Choice between Legendre, Chebyshev, trapezoidal, or Hermite-Simpson based collocation
- Automatic scaling
- Automatic first and second derivatives using the ADOL-C library
- Numerical differentiation by using sparse finite differences
- Automatic mesh refinement
- Automatic identification of the Jacobian and Hessian sparsity.
- DAE formulation, so that differential and algebraic constraints can be implemented in the same C++ function.

The PSOPT interface uses both Eigen3 (a linear algebra template library) and ADOL-C (an automatic differentiation library).

The first release of PSOPT was published in 2009. This is release 5 of PSOPT.

Getting started
---------------

Please consult the detailed installation instructions in the [PSOPT PDF documentation](https://github.com/PSOPT/psopt/blob/master/doc/PSOPT_Manual_R5.pdf). In the following, we only summarize some main points.

### Dependencies

PSOPT requires the following libraries:

1. [IPOPT](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt )
2. [ADOL-C](https://github.com/coin-or/ADOL-C)
3. [EIGEN3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)

Optionally, the user may wish to employ the following software
1. [SNOPT](http://www.sbsi-sol-optimize.com/manuals/SNOPT-Manual.pdf)
2. [GNUplot](http://www.gnuplot.info)

Moreover, PSOPT is built using [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/). CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software. The build process also requires the [pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/) tool.  

### Build

After installation of dependencies, a typical PSOPT build and installation on a Unix-like operating system follows these steps (please see the [PDF documentation](https://github.com/PSOPT/psopt/blob/master/doc/PSOPT_Manual_R5.pdf) for futher details):

1. Download and extract the installation archive from the GItHub project page. Alternatively, the source code can be cloned using git, by issuing the following command: 
         `git clone https://github.com/PSOPT/psopt.git`
2. `cd psopt; mkdir build; cd build`
3. `cmake -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON ..`
4. `make`
4. `sudo make install`

Please note that the minimum version of CMake that is required by the build process is 3.12. Earlier versions of CMake are not suitable.

If you use [Ubuntu 20.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/), all dependencies plus GNUplot can simply be installed as follows:

1. `sudo apt-get install libboost-dev`
2. `sudo apt-get install libboost-system-dev`
3. `sudo apt-get install coinor-libipopt-dev`
4. `sudo apt-get install libadolc-dev`
5. `sudo apt-get install gnuplot`
6. `sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev`
7. `sudo apt-get install libblas-dev`
7. `sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev`


If you use [OpenSuse Leap 15.4](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/15.4/), all dependencies plus GNUplot can be installed as follows:

1. `sudo zypper install git`
2. `sudo zypper install gnuplot`
3. `sudo zypper install libboost_system1_66_0-devel`
4. `sudo zypper install eigen3-devel`
5. `sudo zypper install ColPack-devel`
6. `sudo zypper install adolc-devel`
7. `sudo zypper install blas-devel`
8. `sudo zypper install lapack-devel`
9. `sudo zypper ar -f https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/science/15.4/ science`
10. `sudo zypper install Ipopt-devel`
11. `sudo zypper install cmake`
12. `sudo zypper install gcc-c++`
